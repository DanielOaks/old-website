================

I have a new site, developed with Jekyll!

First off, Jekyll, even for someone who doesn't like Ruby too much, is amazingly awesome. Writing up extensions is a snap (even if I do need to search up some Ruby syntax occasionally), and I really like static sites.

So, let's talk about what I did to get Jekyll working nicely for me:


Category and Tag auto generation
--------------------------------

So basically, I like having a nice url such as ```danneh.net/music``` for my ```music``` category. I had a search around, and found that there was a prebuilt example on the [Jekyll wiki pages](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Plugins), score!

So this is the default category generation page:

{% highlight ruby %}
module Jekyll

  class CategoryPage < Page
    def initialize(site, base, dir, category)
      @site = site
      @base = base
      @dir = dir
      @name = 'index.html'

      self.process(@name)
      self.read_yaml(File.join(base, '_layouts'), 'category_index.html')
      self.data['category'] = category

      category_title_prefix = site.config['category_title_prefix'] || 'Category: '
      self.data['title'] = "#{category_title_prefix}#{category}"
    end
  end

  class CategoryPageGenerator < Generator
    safe true
    
    def generate(site)
      if site.layouts.key? 'category_index'
        dir = site.config['category_dir'] || 'categories'
        site.categories.keys.each do |category|
          site.pages << CategoryPage.new(site, site.source, File.join(dir, category), category)
        end
      end
    end
  end

end
{% endhighlight %}

Fairly simple, and it works alright. However, there are a few differences that I'd like to make:

* First off, this only handles categories, whereas I would like it to support tags as well
* I use quite a simple structure, and only need a single template for /all/ the autogenerated list pages (categories, tags, even the main site index), so let's use that instead
