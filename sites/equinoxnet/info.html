				<h2><a id="_connecting"></a>Connecting</h2>
				<p>We don’t necessarily want many users, quality before quantity</p>
				<p>Connect to <a href="irc://irc.equinox.net">irc.equinoxnet.org</a> for a roundrobin of all servers, or pick a server from the <a href="#_staffservers">server list</a></p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text">
				<h2><a id="_ourgoal"></a>Our Goal</h2>
				<p>First and foremost, having a network where idiots are dealt with appropriately. Nobody likes people joining a channel with some discussion about C pointers in structs and asking "omg u guys r talkin so hrd!!!!!!1111 i cnat undertand u!!!1", right?</p>
				<p>That's the main reason equinox<span class="equinoxblue">net</span> was founded</p>
			</div>
			<div class="indent">
				<h2><a id="_dealingwithidiots"></a>How do you deal with idiots?</h2>
				<p>The servers' operators and administrator will most likely K:line people who lack obvious common sense and refuse to learn and behave. If people feel nice, they may get away with just a kill</p>
				<p>Do you really want some random guy stalking you to every channel, asking if you play Pokémon and as soon as you’ve shown yourself knowledgeable, bother you for every minor bullshit like registering nicks/channels, setting channel modes, …?</p>
				<p>If you do, then you’re on the wrong network</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text">
				<h2><a id="_lookingfor"></a>What are you looking for right now?</h2>
				<p>The world’s okay, money still doesn’t grow on trees, but we don’t need anything here</p>
				<p>Thanks for asking, though</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text">
				<h2><a id="_policies"></a>Network-wide Policies</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Spamming or flooding of any kind will not be tolerated</li>
					<li>Do not try to impersonate anyone. You will regret it</li>
					<li>Evading bans is a no-go</li>
					<li>IRCop decisions are not up for debate</li>
					<li>Do not act against international law or the law of the country the respective server is at</li>
					<li>No XDCC bots are allowed</li>
					<li>No child pornography may be shared</li>
					<li>You may not harbor a botnet on this network</li>
					<li>You will not launch any malicious attacks against this network</li>
					<li>Channels that allow pornography and other content not suitable for minors are required to have a clearly visible warning in their channel topic</li>
					<li>You are responsible for all actions from your IP</li>
					<li>We do not want censorship</li>
					<li>Use common sense (Which makes pretty much all from above redundant, but whatever…)</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="indent">
				<h2><a id="_vhosts"></a>vHosts</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Domain ownership must be proven on any valid domain. in-addr.arpa and 1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa do not need that and are free to use until someone uses them</li>
					<li>Any hosts in the equinox/ or equinoxnet/ trees must have valid reasoning behind it, and are mostly forbidden</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Network-wide games like a Uno or Werewolf bot are likely to get something like equinox/gamebots/botnick accepted</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="indent">
				<h2><a id="_operpolicies"></a>Note on oper policies</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Everyone likes fun network staff, so you may use your power occasionally for a (hopefully good) joke in friendly terms. Just don’t overdo it, thanks. Note that this permission will be removed if users are bothered too much by it</li>
					<li>We avoid to spy on our users as much as possible. Privacy is important</li>
					<li>Common sense is just as required for opers as for users</li>
					<li>We’ll test things in specific testing channels, unless a user specifically wishes and requires an action tested in his/her specific channel</li>
					<li>Don’t be a dick. Just because we don’t want stupid people, that doesn’t mean you can slack off and ignore all user queries. Questions may still be valid and things can be difficult to find out</li>
					<li>Your O:line will be immediately suspended if you’re caught giving/sharing your oper account. <span class="bold">NO EXCEPTIONS</span></li>
				</ul>

				<h2><a id="_staffservers"></a>Staff and Servers</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="irc://hydra.equinoxnet.org">hydra.equinoxnet.org</a> (SSL on 6697, normal client port on 6667)</li>

				<h2><a id="_hierachy"></a>Staff hierachy</h2>
				<p>Not much to say here. Server admin outranks global oper. That’s all there is to it, only two types of opers. The server admins are required to hold votes about any decision that affects the entire network, opers may or may not be asked for input, but it’s often the case</p>

				<h2><a id="_softwareinfo"></a>Software information</h2>
				<p>We’re using <a href="http://www.atheme.net/">Atheme</a> as our services package, running with <a href="http://www.inspircd.org/">InspIRCd</a>. Status modes +vho are enabled</p>

				<h2><a id="_history"></a>History</h2>
				<p>equinox<span class="equinoxblue">net</span> started as “OldeIRC” as an attempt to get nostalgic IRC running again. No services and ircd 2.8. But neither did I fully set it up nor did anyone really care</p>
				<p>Later on, I got an idea that was already taken earlier on “Anet” for Anarchy Net. The past has shown that it just doesn’t work. There needs to be some controlling force, though AbleNET takes an insteresting way of a pure and utter lack of IRC operators</p>
				<p>Three O:lines later, I was fed up with morons joining #help being too lazy to look up even most basic stuff and too stupid to understand commands. That was when I got the idea for equinox<span class="equinoxblue">net</span></p>
			</div>
			<div class="indent">
				<h2><a id="_2010"></a>2010</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>May 21st, I started working on the server configurations, originally as HydraNET. HydraNET was scrapped and renamed to Cynthia, and later to solsticeNET</li>
					<li>May 22nd, I started working on the site</li>
					<li>At some point between June 14 and July 11, I decided to switch from InspIRCd to ShadowIRCd after all. I’m sorry that I can’t be more specific</li>
					<li>July 11th, due to a name conflict with <a href="http://www.solsticenet.com/">solsticenet.com</a>, it was required to rename to equinox<span class="equinoxblue">net</span>. Big thanks to TheTitan on EFnet for the name idea!</li>
					<li>October 12th, I rewrote and updated the entire page once again</li>
					<li>October 16th, it was possible to find a server, sponsored by Lord-Harlot. Big thanks!</li>
					<li>October 19th, the domain equinoxnet.org was sponsored by nicholas. Thanks to you, too!</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="indent">
				<h2><a id="_2011"></a>2011</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>February 8th, I modified ShadowIRCd to allow the characters / and . in nicks. It’s a non-standard feature, if there are any problems with that, please inform me</li>
					<li>March 3rd, there was a move back to InspIRCd due to some Unreal-isms in ShadowIRCd and it not really wanting to co-operate with my server. There was a server move some time in between, too. The / and . nick characters were kept</li>
